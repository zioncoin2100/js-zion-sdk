   * By default, {@link TransactionBuilder} uses the current local time, but

   * more assurance that your timebounds will reflect what you want.
   *
   * Note that this will generate your timebounds when you **init the transaction**,
   * not when you build or submit the transaction! So give yourself enough time to get
   * the transaction built and signed before submitting.
   *
   * Example:
   *
   * ```javascript
   * const transaction = new ZionSdk.TransactionBuilder(accountId, {
   *  fee: await ZionSdk.Server.fetchBaseFee(),
   *  timebounds: await ZionSdk.Server.fetchTimebounds(100)
   * })
   *  .addOperation(operation)
   *  // normally we would need to call setTimeout here, but setting timebounds
   *  // earlier does the trick!
   *  .build();
   * ```
   * @argument {number} seconds Number of seconds past the current time to wait.
   * @argument {bool} [_isRetry=false] True if this is a retry. Only set this internally!
   * This is to avoid a scenario where Equator is horking up the wrong date.
   * @returns {Promise<Timebounds>} Promise that resolves a `timebounds` object

   * deleted without reaching the orderbook or being matched (possibly because
   * your amounts were rounded down to zero). So treat the just-submitted offer
   * request as if it never happened.
   * * If `wasPartiallyFilled` is true, you can tell the user that `amountBought`
